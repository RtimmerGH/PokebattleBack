This is the repo for the Back app of Pokebattle

This repo contains the back part of the project I developped during the Wild Code School Checkpoint 4 in February 2023. I chose to work on a small game about Pokemon. Checkpoint lasted 2 days and I worked 2 more days to improve design, add features, fix bugs and deploy the app. Back has been done with Express.

Application is available here: https://pokebattle-wcs.netlify.app/
